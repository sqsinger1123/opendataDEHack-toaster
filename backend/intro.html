<p>
	Dear [first_name],</p>
<p>
	As the 132<sup>nd</sup> Harvard-Yale game approaches this Saturday (a reminder that we are gathering with members of the Yale Club of Ontario to watch at Real Sports at 2:30 pm; see <a href="http://www.harvardcluboftoronto.com/article.html?aid=225"><strong>here</strong></a> for details), we hope you are looking forward to another season of exciting Club events. As always, look out for monthly updates from the Club outlining the events and initiatives in store for each month.</p>
<p>
	This past year the Club sponsored a particularly strong lineup of events that enlightened our membership and brought the Toronto Harvard community (and beyond) closer together. From an all-Ivy League pub night, to a private TIFF reception, to a fireside chat with one of Canada’s foremost China experts—all of these events were made possible thanks to the active engagement and support of the Club’s members.</p>
<p>
	We invite you to <a href="http://www.harvardcluboftoronto.com/renew.html"><strong>renew your Club membership</strong></a> for the 2016 calendar year. If you renew now, your membership will continue through the end of 2016. Each year, membership in the Club offers access to a number of exclusive events and initiatives. Below are some highlights from the Club’s past year of programming.</p>
<p>
	Warm regards,</p>
<p>
